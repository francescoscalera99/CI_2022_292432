Given a number N and some lists of integers P = (L_0, L_1, L_2, ..., L_n),
determine, if possible, S = (L_{s_0}, L_{s_1}, L_{s_2}, ..., L_{s_n}),
such that each number between 0 and N-1 appears in at least one list.

We decided to use the A* searching algorithm that professor showed us during the lectures,
adapting it to the problem provided.

In particular, our implementation concerns:
 - The choice of an appropriate priority function for the frontier,
   based on the summation of length of subset of list (our current state) and the number of elements that we need to complete the task assigned
 - We chose the length of a list as a unit cost of an action
 - We sorted the list set by the length of each list
 - In order to reduce the computation complexity, we discarded the list duplicates from the initial state
 - After generating the initial block (list of lists) we just kept the unique values 

## Results

Here we display for our A* algorithm the number of steps it took to find a solution, the number of visited states and the weight of the final solution i.e. the sum of lenght of the internal lists.
The tests were repeated 10 times.

For N = [100, 500, 1000] we were not able to find a proper optimization of the algorithm to find the optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time so we tried to use a unitary cost for all (uninformed strategy) the edges and we noticed that, as expected the algorithm was really fast but the solution was not the optimal one in fact we have an exponential increasing of the bloat as we can see from the results reported in the table. A possible approach for further and future implementation could be the pruning of the graph in terms of depth.
